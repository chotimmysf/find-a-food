<strong>BACKSTORY</strong>

This project was inspired by the "Meal Finder" project in this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/learn/lecture/17842006#overview" target="_blank">Vanilla JavaScript Course.</a> I made my first API-based web app with JavaScript and learning more of JavaScript's capabilities.

<strong>PROJECT JOURNEY INSIGHTS</strong>

This was my first project where I used an API - I learned that if I use an API, I have to adjust my code to respond to the API - for example, I have to define my variables exactly like the variables the API used.

<strong>APP OVERVIEW</strong>

1. Search Bar

   Type the name of a food item to let the web app fetch information from an API in order to find possible results for the food entered. The search bar also generates a random recipe.

2. Search Results

   After entering a search term, all recipes containing the search term were show.

3. Recipe Picture

   When a picture of a search result is selected, the directions, ingredients, and type of food is presented below the search results.

<strong>TECHNOLOGIES USED</strong>

JavaScript

Meal Finder API

HTML

CSS

<strong>CHALLENGES</strong>

Time Management: Keeping app development within 1 week scope - I spent 3 weeks building this app.

Random Button: I was unsure of how to make the random button function separate from the search bar, so the random function will still occur when the search bar is pressed.

<strong>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</strong>

Ensure the random food function instantly generates a random meal rather than do nothing.

Prevent the random food feature from running when the search bar is clicked on.
